/*Sliding Window is the method of flow control TCP uses. The algorithm basically places a buffer between the application and the network data flow. 
The purpose of sliding window is to prevent from the sender to send too many packets to over flow the network resource or the receiver's buffer.
The "sliding window size" is the maximum amount of data we can send without having to wait for ACK. TCP achieve the flow control by using the 
sliding Window algorithm which takes into consideration 2 important parameters. The first one is the receiver advertised window size which basically
tells the sender what is the current buffer of TCP receiver, the second parameter is congestion window which control the number of packets a TCP
flow may have in the network in any given time.
